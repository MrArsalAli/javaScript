            <h5 class="card-title">The Last Library</h5>
            <p class="card-text">In a small, forgotten town nestled between ancient mountains, there stood a library unlike any other. The townsfolk
                believed it had always been there, its towering spires scraping the sky and its endless corridors filled
                with books that whispered secrets from eras long past. But this was no ordinary library. The Last Library,
                as it was known, contained every book ever written and every book yet to be imagined. The shelves were filled
                with volumes that told of worlds unknown, of futures unwritten, and of pasts that never were. The librarian,
                an old man named Elias, had guarded the library for as long as anyone could remember. His hair was silver,
                his eyes sharp, and his hands steady as he guided visitors through the maze of knowledge. Few came to the
                library these days, for the town had dwindled in size and people no longer valued the old ways. One day,
                a young girl named Lina arrived at the library's grand doors. She had heard stories from her grandmother
                about the magical place where dreams were stored in books, and she was determined to see it for herself.
                As she stepped inside, the air buzzed with energy, and she felt a shiver of excitement. Elias welcomed her
                with a kind smile and asked, "What is it you seek, young one?" Lina, with wide eyes, replied, "I want to
                read a story that no one has ever read before." Elias nodded thoughtfully and led her to a section of the
                library that seemed to stretch into infinity. The books here were blank, their pages waiting to be filled
                with stories yet to be told. He handed her a quill and an empty book. "In the Last Library," Elias said,
                "the greatest stories are not found—they are created. You are the author of your own tale." Lina took the
                quill and began to write. As she did, the blank pages filled with vibrant images, each word coming to life
                in front of her eyes. She wrote of a world where the stars sang, where rivers ran with liquid light, and
                where the bravest hearts were those that sought knowledge. Days turned into weeks, but Lina never tired.
                The more she wrote, the more she discovered about herself and the world around her. She realized that the
                stories in the Last Library were not just tales of adventure—they were reflections of the soul. Finally,
                when her story was complete, Elias took the book and placed it on the shelf beside countless others. "You
                have added to the library’s wisdom," he said. "Your story will guide others, just as you were guided." Lina
                left the library that day with a heart full of wonder. She knew she would return, for the Last Library was
                not just a place—it was a journey. And as long as there were stories to tell, the library would never fade,
                its doors always open to those brave enough to step inside.</p>
